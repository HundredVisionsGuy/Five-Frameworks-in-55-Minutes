## Introductions
* Who is this presenter?
* Why? Why do this? How might this be important?
* What tools do we need?

### Who is this presenter

* CS Teacher at Century HS since 2005-06
  - [@centuryhstech](https://www.instagram.com/centuryhstech/?hl=en)
  - [chsweb.org](https://chsweb.org)
  - [Hundredvisionsguy YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaK-mU6spvlU_UssdgkN-bg?view_as=subscriber) 
* WordPress Front-end Developer
  - Latest project was [OregonCSTA.org website](http://oregoncsta.org/)
* Web and Web Dev afficionado
* Student of Web Development


### Why?
* This is where industry is at
* Frameworks speed up development time
* Frameworks solve many common problems in CSS
* Frameworks have many applications (layouts, typography, animations, functionality)

### Why in the classroom?
* Students learn industry standard techniques
* It helps move students more quickly towards realizing their visions
* It adds a much needed wow factor in the classroom
  - as opposed to working hard for little reward/payoff
* It provides a learning opportunity to see how professionals have solved technically difficult challenges (especially with layouts)
* It makes the jump from Web Design to Web Development and helps bring in CS concepts more quickly

## What's a framework?
> *[CSS frameworks provide a basic structure for designing consistent solutions to tackle common recurring issues across front end web development.](https://blog.zipboard.co/a-beginners-guide-to-css-front-end-frameworks-8045a499456b)*

* There are front-end frameworks and backend frameworks
* There are frameworks for a very specific design challenge
  - like implementing a responsive grid
  - or implementing animations
  - or iconography
* There are full-blown frameworks that solve most design patterns for a website
  - such as Bootstrap, which began as the Twitter library
### Front-end Frameworks
* Front-end frameworks typically contain 1 or more style sheets and 1 or more JavaScript scripts
* You typically create UI elements and components by adding classes to your HTML
  - The CSS stylesheet does the rest
* Sometimes you can just pick and choose what you want from the Framework to lower load times
* You can use what you want and customize the rest
### JavaScript Frameworks
* The 3 Most popular JavaScript Frameworks are:
  - React
  - Angular
  - VueJS
* There are others
* They are typically JavaScript Frameworks that run on the server 
* They sometimes complement the HTML
* Other times, they generate the HTML

Unfortunately, we won't have the time to take a deep dive in the JS Frameworks.

## Tools you'll want
* CodePen 
  - this is a free online based tool that keeps getting better
  - this opens up the possiblity for chromebook 
  - We'll begin our presentation with my blank slate Codepen called **[CSS Framework Template](https://codepen.io/hundredvisionsguy/pen/QWwxVop)**
* Optional tools worth looking at:
  - VS Code (essential text editor)
    You can [download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - NodeJS (for JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular)
    + Note: you can install this on a chromebook if you have terminal, but I am not sure how possible that is or how excited your IT folks will be

## Getting Started

This is the general flow of things:
1. Begin by creating a CodePen Account
2. Next, fork my [CodePen CSS Framework template](https://codepen.io/hundredvisionsguy/pen/QWwxVop)
3. Convert that pen into a CodePen template
4. For each Framework, create a new pen from your template
5. We'll hit several highlights for each framework

After this workshop, you should have the confidence to further explore

NOTE: Code samples are included in the samples directory

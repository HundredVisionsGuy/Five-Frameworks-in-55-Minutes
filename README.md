3. 5 Frameworks
4. Other interesting frameworks

Introductions
-----------
* Who is this presenter?
* Why? Why do this? How might this be important?
* What tools do we need?

### Who is this presenter

* CS Teacher at Century HS since 2005-06
  - [@centuryhstech](https://www.instagram.com/centuryhstech/?hl=en)
  - [chsweb.org](https://chsweb.org)
  - [Hundredvisionsguy YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaK-mU6spvlU_UssdgkN-bg?view_as=subscriber) 
* WordPress Front-end Developer
  - Latest project was [OregonCSTA.org website](http://oregoncsta.org/)
* Web and Web Dev afficionado
* Student of Web Development


## Why?
* This is where industry is at
* Frameworks speed up development time
* Frameworks solve many common problems in CSS
* Frameworks have many applications (layouts, typography, animations, functionality)

### Why in the classroom?
* Students learn industry standard techniques
* It helps move students more quickly towards realizing their visions
* It adds a much needed wow factor in the classroom
  - as opposed to working hard for little reward/payoff
* It provides a learning opportunity to see how professionals have solved technically difficult challenges (especially with layouts)
* It makes the jump from Web Design to Web Development and helps bring in CS concepts more quickly

Tools you'll want
---------
* CodePen 
  - this is a free online based tool that keeps getting better
  - this opens up the possiblity for chromebook 
  - We'll begin our presentation with my blank slate Codepen called **[CSS Framework Template](https://codepen.io/hundredvisionsguy/pen/QWwxVop)**
* Optional tools worth looking at:
  - VS Code (essential text editor)
    You can [download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - NodeJS (for JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular)
    + Note: you can install this on a chromebook if you have terminal, but I am not sure how possible that is or how excited your IT folks will be
